This directory contains the software to generate  a paper version of the
XPCE Reference manual from the PCE online manuals.

PROCEDURE

First, the predicate texi/0 defined in texinfo.pl  is used to generate a
Texinfo description of the manual.  The   conversion process to generate
the manual is driven by  the   file  "manual.def" which includes various
other files.  The introduction and some `glue' is described in the *.def
files.  The remainder of the material comes from XPCE itself.

The output of texi is the file refman.texinfo.  This file may be typeset
using:

	% tex refman.texinfo
	% texindex refman.??
	% tex refman.texinfo
	% texindex refman.??
	% tex refman.texinfo

[The extra phase is necessary because pages are shifted a bit due to all
<undefined> references]

REQUIRED SOFTWARE

	# `TeX' with sufficient memory (I used TeX 3.141 with the
	`poolsize' enlarged from 140KB to 240 KB).

	# `texindex' is available from most gnu distributing ftp sites.
	It is used to generate the indexes.

	# XPCE/SWI-Prolog.  The conversion routines should be easily
	ported to other Prolog systems.
