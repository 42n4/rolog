#chapter Message Passing, Types and Arguments

This chapter defines classes that support argument passing, argument
specification and type checking.  Classes:

	type		Type specification, validation and conversion
	:=		Specifying argument by name instead of position
	code_vector	Pack multiple arguments

More information about message passing may be found with the classes
class, method, send_method, get_method and variable.

#description group meta
The methods in this group have been implemented with a specific
application in mind.  Better thought on the semantics of types
is needed to provide a balanced set of methods to reason about
relations between type objects.  Donot rely on the definitions
of these methods.
