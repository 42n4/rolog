#chapter Data Organisation Classes

This chapter describes the XPCE classes that deal with the organisation
of arbitrary data objects and tables.  These classes are:

	chain		Single-linked list.
	vector		Array of elements.  Dynamic allocation.
	sheet		Mapping, normally name/value pairs.
	hash_table	Mapping, fast lookup.
	chain_table	Mapping 1 to N.  fast lookup.
	table		Multicolumn table with key-fields.
	tuple		Pair of objects.

Note that their are two other chapters dealing with data: primitive
data objects (strings, identifiers, numbers, booleans, etc.) and 
datatypes to support graphical objects (points, cursors, fonts, etc.).

#class chain

#description group current
This section describe operations that exploit or modify the `current' cell.
This mechanism is obsolete.  The relavant methods are retained for backward
compatibility only.
#end description

#description group cell
This section describes methods that operate directly on the cells of the
linked list.  Cells are no true objects and their reference is therefore
passes as an integer.

These methods are not intended for general usage.
