prog/patterns    Small scale patterns and textures

This directory contains tile patterns which can be used by paint
programs and for background displays.

These patterns can also be used on color displays by specifing appropriate
forground and background colors in the `setroot' command. By careful
choice of colors some very wierd effects can be produced.

For Examples of commands you can use on a color display look at the file
``support/misc/xbgnd_cmd_list''.
