The package directory  contains  a   subdirectory  for  each  SWI-Prolog
package. Without packages, SWI-Prolog is called SWI-Prolog/lite.

Building
--------

To build these packages, first build  and install SWI-Prolog itself This
creates Makefile, copying some of the   configuration  settings from the
SWI-Prolog configuration options.

If you plan to install  XPCE   (strongly  recommended  for better online
help, graphical tracer, integrated  editor   and  powerful GUI toolkit),
make sure to have the following installed in a searchable place:

	* libjpeg  (http://www.ijg.org/)
	* libXPM   (http://www-sop.inria.fr/koala/lehors/xpm.html)
	* The X11 development headers and libraries

Here are the required packages on   some package-based installations. In
general, you need the X  development  package.   libjpeg  is  often in a
separate package. Recent X development packages contain the Xpm library.
In older versions this is often a  separate package If your distribution
contains a development package for one of these libraries, use this.

Please contribute this information for  your   distribution  by  mail to

The packages to be build are specified in the configure script, variable
PKG. You can specify this list on the commandline using -for example-

	env PKG="clib sgml" ./configure

or you can modify the  default   list  using --with-PKG or --without-PKG
options. Most of the packages  are  designed   not  to  build or install
anything if they discover that  the   build  environment  lacks features
requirted by the package.

	./configure
	make
	make install

Each package comes with its own documentation. This documentation may be
installed in the directory $(PLBASE)/doc/packages in  either HTML or PDF
format using one of the commands:

	make html-install
	make pdf-install
