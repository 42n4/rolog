				XPCE TODO List

Frames and Windows
==================

One of the annoying things at the moment   is that frames are no windows
and therefore can be nested nor  embedded   in  other  XPCE GUI stuff. I
propose to make class frame a subclass  of class Window, providing tiled
layout of subwindows. Other things that gets   closer  with this are MDI
and `docking' as windows can be re-parented more easily.

The other toplevel (shell-widget) code of class Frame can be integrated
in class Window.  Steps:

	* Create class frame_window below window and move the client-side
          (tile) stuff there.

	* Move relevant frame behaviour to class window.

	* Remove class frame and rename frame_window to frame.

Consequences:

	* Simple windows (no tiled) that are ->open'ed no longer have an
	  associated frame.

	* <-frame will need an extra argument to indicate the desired frame
	  as frames are now nested.

Text handling
=============

The use of LocalString() can cause   problems.  Errors from alloca() are
non-portable and some systems have severe limits on what you can do with
alloca().
