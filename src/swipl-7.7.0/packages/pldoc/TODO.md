# TODO

PlDoc once was very simple,  mostly  based   on  Twiki  with some Prolog
extensions.  Then  came  along,   media    wiki,   doxygen,  github  and
stackoverflow and the Prolog commons attempt  to synchronise things. All
this  left  some  traces  in  the  current  wiki  processor,  making  it
unpredictable and unstable.

  - Rationalise and formalise the wiki syntax.
    - Given current developments, Github and Stackoverflow wiki
      notation, both based on the JavaScript
      [showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) should
      be leading.
    - (Mostly) unambiguous older conventions can be kept, e.g.
      `---+ Title` style headers.
