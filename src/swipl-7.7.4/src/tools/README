This directory contains tools developed to  find the consequences of the
stack-shifter. This tool-chain is designed   for  GNU/Linux systems. The
main program is update-deps. It is used as follows:

    * Add  -fdump-rtl-expand to COFLAGS and the Makefile and recompile.
    This causes GCC to generate RTL-dumps of the compiler in addition
    to its normal output.  Make sure to drop optimization (O*).

    * Run tools/update-deps *.expand. This generates file.c.tree,
    which represents the call-tree (in Prolog format) and
    file.c.functions, which represents the line-range for functions,
    including virtual machine instruction implementations (VMI(...)) and
    predicates (PRED_IMPL(...)).

    * For problems with C-recursion, run tools/recursive.pl

    * Use analysis.pl to find problematic code fragments.
