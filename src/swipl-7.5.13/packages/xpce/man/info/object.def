#chapter Objects, Relations and Attributes

This chapter deals with general object management: creation of objects,
destruction, programming individual objects (PCE offers both programming
at the object level and at the class level), etc.  The classes discussed
are:

	object		The root of the inheritance tree.
	attribute	Object-level attribute (cf. instance variable)
	hyper		Binary relation between two objects.
