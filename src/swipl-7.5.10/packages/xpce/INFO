OS Platforms:
=============

	Unix/X11 (most brands, including 64-bit platforms)
	Win32    (Windows 95/98/ME, NT/2000/XP, Intel)
	
Hosting languages
=================

	SWI-Prolog	http://www.swi-prolog.org

	Ports to the following have existed and are in not too bad
	shape.

	Quintus Prolog	http://www.sics.se/quintus/
	SICStus Prolog  http://www.sics.se/
	
	Considering the costs of maintaining portable Prolog
	code given the current status of the standard, we will only
	produce versions for other Prolog systems if this situation
	improves or we get hold of sufficient resources to maintain
	portability.

Documentation
=============

	# Programming in XPCE/Prolog
	Userguide to get you started.  Explains the interface, object
	model as well as creating new classes.  Provides `technique'
	sections, explaining how commonly encountered problems may
	be solved using XPCE.

	# Course Notes
	Document explaining roughly the same material as ``Programming
	in XPCE/Prolog'' in a condensed form.

	# Reference Manual
	Available using the built-in online help-system.  Includes
	various fully dynamic viewpoints to the reference material.
