The UXNT.LIB library is used SWI-Prolog and XPCE   to make the NT and 95
filesystem a bit more like the Unix one. It deals with mapping directory
separators, ensuring there are only single   separators (mapping // to \
for example) that root-directories of devices   (c:/,  etc.) are handled
properly, no matter how the name is formed. It also implemends readdir()
and friends for Unix-compatible access to the directory.
