				XPCE Agenda


TO DO:
	*) Selection Service interaction (not only cut-buffers)
	*) Editor/Text
		1) Multi Kills backward: buggy
		2) Handle non-printable characters correctly
	*) Bitmaps:
		1) Scaling
		2) Stencils
	*) `Resizer' object: inverted box to avoid redisplay
		1) ->object: Graphical*
		2) ->active: Boolean
		3) ->execute: move attached object
	*) Creating new expression classes?
	*) NAME_forwards AND NAME_forward!!
	*) Window ->grab_keyboard werkt niet zonder Window ->grab_pointer!
	*) list_browser, editor: subclass of dialog_item?
	*) Efficient constraint handling for spatials
		1) Trap updates for spatials at class graphical?
	*) Communicate with host on CWD (current directory)
	*) Clone/save:
		3) Relations (connection, constraint, hyper):
			- Internal <-> external relations
	*) Creation: exploit `variable <-initial_value' (also function)
	   Integrate with resource system.  Part of `object ->initialise'?
	*) Improve consistency of groups
	*) Print \t as space for xwn-draw.c text functions
	*) Add ->report: progress and ->report: done
	 
Multi-Screen access 

	*) Resolve logical-font names.
	*) Handling destruction of visual tool
	*) Fix bitmaps
	*) Resolve CurrentDisplay usage;
	      1) Display of current-event?
	      2) DisplayManager <- current
	      3) Display of some graphical
	*) Display <->class --> resource_class
