			    The XPCE UserGuide

This directory contains the sources to   the XPCE userguide. To generate
you need a Unix machine with pdflatex.  We've (July 2005) used a machine
running SuSE linux 9.2. 

You also need to install xpce first as  this is used for generating part
of the PostScript diagrams on the fly.

If all tools are  installed  properly,   a  simple  "make" should create
xpceusg.pdf.
