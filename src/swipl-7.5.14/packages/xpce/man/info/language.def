#chapter Language Definition

This chapter describes the classes that will be used in the future to
support te definition of parsers.

On the basis of these classes, future versions of PCE will define a
syntax to create objects and send messages.  If one is able to create
objects and send messages, it is possible to program PCE by creating
classes, methods, etc.  The definition of such a language makes it
possible to define library modules that are independant of the host
language PCE is connected to.  It also makes it possible not to connect
PCE to any host language.

Overview:

	syntax_table	Basic properties of characters
	tokeniser	Tokenisation (programmable)
	operator	Prolog-like operator declarations
	parser		Parser building blocks

The current version of this manual only describes class syntax_table
as this class is also used by the classes regex and text_buffer to
realise syntax directed editors (see PceEmacs).  The other classes
are considered too immature for printing their documentation.
