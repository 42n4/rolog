#chapter Dialogs and Menus

This chapter describes the PCE classes to build dialogue boxes.  The
classes used to build dialogue boxes are a specialisation of the generic
graphics classes of XPCE.  Class dialog and class dialog_item add
automatic layout and protocols to deal with keyboard accelerators,
`applying changes' and restoring the dialog box.
