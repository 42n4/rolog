#chapter Variables and Assigment

This chapter discusses PCE dynamically bound variable objects and
assignments to them.  Before arriving at this chapter you are very
likely to have used these objects without noticing.  Most applications
builders will never manipulate these objects explicitely.

The normal application programmer will use the predefined var objects
@receiver, @event, @arg1, @arg2, etc.  Reading this chapter may be
useful for a better understanding of these `magic' object references.
Explicit creation and assignment to variables is sometimes necessary
when creating complicated code objects.

Class var defines variables as functions (see class function).  Class
assign is an excutable object that may be used to assign to a var.
