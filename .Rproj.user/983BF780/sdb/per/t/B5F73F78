What we want is\n# DT_RUNPATH, which is behind LD_LIBRARY_PATH  in the search-order. This\n# however cannot be set  directly  on   some  systems.  Therefore, where\n# available, we use chrpath -c in the  Makefile to convert DT_RPATH into\n# DT_RUNPATH. If this process fails,  you   may  have problems upgrading\n# SWI-Prolog from source because the version-being-built uses the shared\n# object from the installed version. If  the installed version is broken\n# or incompatible, your build will  fail.   There  are  two ways around:\n# install chrpath (if available) or remove   the installed system before\n# rebuilding.\n\nbdir=/homed/Dropbox/rolog/rolog/src/swipl-7.5.1/src\nlib=$bdir/../lib/i386-win32\nlibso=$lib/libswipl.dll\nsep=\":\"\n\nif [ \":\" != \":\" ]; then\n  lib=\"$(: -w $lib)\"\n  sep=\";\"\nfi\n\nif [ \"x$PATH\" = \"x\" ]; then\n  PATH=\"$lib\"\nelse\n  PATH=\"$lib$sep$PATH\"\nfi\n\nexport PATH\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n  -C) cd \"$2\"\n      shift\n      shift\n      ;;\n   *) ;;\nesac\n\n./bin/swipl.exe \"$@\" || exit 1\n",
